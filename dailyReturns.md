# Daily Returns

## Definition
Daily returns represent the percentage change in the price of a financial asset from one day to the next. They are a crucial metric in finance, as they help investors understand the volatility and performance of an asset over time.

## Formula
The formula to calculate the daily return is:

\[
\text{Daily Return} = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} \times 100
\]

Where:
- \( P_t \) = Price of the asset on day \( t \)
- \( P_{t-1} \) = Price of the asset on the previous day

## Interpretation
- A positive daily return indicates that the asset's price has increased compared to the previous day.
- A negative daily return indicates a decrease in the asset's price.
- Daily returns can be used to assess the performance of an investment over time and to compare the volatility of different assets.

## Example Calculation
Assume the closing prices of a stock for two consecutive days are as follows:
- Day 1: $100
- Day 2: $105

The daily return for Day 2 would be calculated as:

\[
\text{Daily Return} = \frac{105 - 100}{100} \times 100 = 5\%
\]

## Importance of Daily Returns
1. **Volatility Measurement**: Daily returns are used to calculate the volatility of an asset, which is essential for risk assessment.
2. **Performance Analysis**: Investors can analyze daily returns to evaluate the performance of their investments over time.
3. **Portfolio Management**: Daily returns help in making informed decisions about asset allocation and portfolio adjustments.

## Conclusion
Daily returns are a fundamental concept in finance that provides insights into the performance and volatility of financial assets. Understanding how to calculate and interpret daily returns is essential for effective investment analysis and decision-making.
